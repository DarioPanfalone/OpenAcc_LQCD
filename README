 Yet Another Lattice Qcd Simulation Suite
               (With OpenAcc)


1. Build

At build time the geometry of the lattice must be known, and must be passed to 
the "configure" script in the 

1.0 Test with gcc
On a system where only gcc is present, 

mkdir build
cd build
../configure CC=gcc CFLAGS="-O3" --prefix=<directory of your choice>
make
make install

should be enough.

1.1 With mpicc


mkdir build
cd build
../configure CC=mpicc CFLAGS="-O3" --prefix=<directory of your choice>
make
make install

1.2 With an OpenAcc-capable compiler
In this case, many more parameters should be specified.
