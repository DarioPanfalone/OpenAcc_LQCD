Next plan is to rewrite how staggered phases must be handled.

The external field will always be present, and it will incorporate
staggered phases, the external abelian field and the chemical
potential. A backfield must be defined for each fermion flavour.

The "BACKFIELD" and "IMCHEMPOT" defines must go away; the logic
involved will always be on, because the external field will always be
present.


Step zero: individuating where the links are multiplied by the
staggered phases and where they are not.
