How the Kogut-Susskind phases (also known as "Staggered Phases")
should be treated in this code.

Assertion: The gauge links MUST NEVER be stored in a state where they
are multiplicated by the staggered phase. All the gauge links are just
plain SU(3) matrices.

Consequences:
The staggered phases are always passed in the "external field".
The external field also incorporates the effect of a static abelian
field and the effect of a nonzero chemical potential.
This means we need a different external field for each of the
flavours.
